# OBS-Scene-Switcher
This is an AutoHotKey script that sends a certain keystroke to a window with "OBS" in it's title if a keyboard key (excluding modifier keys) or mouse button is pressed or if the mouse moves. It sends a different keystroke if a controller button is pressed or if the analog sticks are moved.

The actual keysrokes that are sent can be changed, to do so change the variables at the top of the script, `keybdkey` and `controllerkey`.

Kill-Switch: Shift+F4 will terminate the script.

\*This script does not work with Streamlabs OBS.*

Original idea for this was by ShikenNuggets
